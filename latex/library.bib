  abstract = {This paper revisits the pricing of options, in a context of financial stress, when the underlying asset's returns displays skewness and excess kurtosis. For that purpose, we use a Cornish--Fisher transformation for valuing option contracts with an exact formula allowing for heavy-tails. An application to the S\&P 500 stock index option contracts is carried out during both stress (October 2008) and calm (May 2015) periods. It provides evidence about the capability of the Cornish--Fisher model to fairly price options during a period of stress without violating the skewness--kurtosis boundaries given its large domain of validity. {\copyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hence, for practical purposes, we may treat the exchange rate volatilities and correlations as observed rather than latent. We do so, and we characterize their joint distribution, both unconditionally and conditionally. Noteworthy results include a simple normality-inducing volatility transformation, high contemporaneous correlation across volatilities, high correlation between correlation and volatilities, pronounced and persistent dynamics in volatilities and correlations, evidence of long-memory dynamics in volatilities and correlations, and remarkably precise scaling laws under temporal aggregation.},

Next, using continuously recorded observations for the Deutschemark/Dollar and Yen/Dollar spot exchange rates, we find that forecasts from a simple long--memory Gaussian vector autoregression for the logarithmic daily realized volatilities perform admirably. Moreover, the vector autoregressive volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal--normal mixture distribution produces well--calibrated density forecasts of future returns, and correspondingly accurate quantile predictions. Our results hold promise for practical modeling and forecasting of the large covariance matrices relevant in asset pricing, asset allocation, and financial risk management applications.},

Another mystery that may be resolved is why expected real interest rates were low in the United States during major wars, such as World War II.

The result is a significantly more accessible methodology, in the sense that it is easier to understand and to implement.

Later chapters address areas where saddlepoint methods have had substantial impact: multivariate testing, stochastic systems and applied probability, bootstrap implementation in the transform domain, and Bayesian computation and inference. No previous background in the area is required. Data examples from real applications demonstrate the practical value of the methods. Ideal for graduate students and researchers in statistics, biostatistics, electrical engineering, econometrics, and applied mathematics, this is both an entry-level text and a valuable reference.},

In this model, anticipations, risk aversion, investment alternatives, and preferences about the timing of consumption all play a role in determining bond prices. Many of the factors traditionally mentioned as influencing the term structure are thus included in a way which is fully consistent with maximizing behavior and rational expectations. The model leads to specific formulas for bond prices which are well suited for empirical testing.},

In this incisive and authoritative book, Harald Cram{\'e}r unites these two major lines of development, providing a masterly exposition of the mathematical methods of modern statistics that set the standard in the field still followed today.Requiring only a working knowledge of undergraduate mathematics, this self-contained book begins with an introduction to the fundamental concept of a distribution and of integration with respect to a distribution. It goes on to discuss the general theory of random variables and probability distributions, the theory of sampling, statistical estimation, and tests of significance.Blending lucid and accessible writing with mathematical rigor, Mathematical Methods of Statistics belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in statistical methods and remains the standard reference on the subject today.},

Any two probability distributions whose moments are identical will have identical cumulants as well, and vice versa. The first cumulant is the mean, the second cumulant is the variance, and the third cumulant is the same as the third central moment. But fourth and higher-order cumulants are not equal to central moments. In some cases theoretical treatments of problems in terms of cumulants are simpler than those using moments. In particular, when two or more random variables are statistically independent, the nth-order cumulant of their sum is equal to the sum of their nth-order cumulants. As well, the third and higher-order cumulants of a normal distribution are zero, and it is the only distribution with this property. Just as for moments, where joint moments are used for collections of random variables, it is possible to define joint cumulants.},

  abstract = {It is often required to approximate to the distribution of some statistic whose exact distribution cannot be conveniently obtained. When the first few moments are known, a common procedure is to fit a law of the Pearson or Edgeworth type having the same moments as far as they are given. Both these methods are often satisfactory in practice, but have the drawback that errors in the "tail" regions of the distribution are sometimes comparable with the frequencies themselves. The Edgeworth approximation in particular notoriously can assume negative values in such regions. The characteristic function of the statistic may be known, and the difficulty is then the analytical one of inverting a Fourier transform explicitly. In this paper we show that for a statistic such as the mean of a sample of size n, or the ratio of two such means, a satisfactory approximation to its probability density, when it exists, can be obtained nearly always by the method of steepest descents. This gives an asymptotic expansion in powers of n-1 whose dominant term, called the saddlepoint approximation, has a number of desirable features. The error incurred by its use is O(n-1) as against the more usual O(n-1/2) associated with the normal approximation. Moreover it is shown that in an important class of cases the relative error of the approximation is uniformly O(n-1) over the whole admissible range of the variable. The method of steepest descents was first used systematically by Debye for Bessel functions of large order (Watson [17]) and was introduced by Darwin and Fowler (Fowler [9]) into statistical mechanics, where it has remained an indispensable tool. Apart from the work of Jeffreys [12] and occasional isolated applications by other writers (e.g. Cox [2]), the technique has been largely ignored by writers on statistical theory. In the present paper, distributions having probability densities are discussed first, the saddlepoint approximation and its associated asymptotic expansion being obtained for the probability density of the mean {\=x} of a sample of n. It is shown how the steepest descents technique is related to an alternative method used by Khinchin [14] and, in a slightly different context, by Cramer [5]. General conditions are established under which the relative error of the saddlepoint approximation is O(n-1) uniformly for all admissible {\=x}, with a corresponding result for the asymptotic expansion. The case of discrete variables is briefly discussed, and finally the method is used for approximating to the distribution of ratios.},

Two skewness statistics are examined: the Fisher-Pearson standardized third moment coefficient, and the Pearson 2 coefficient that compares the mean and median. The former is reported in statistical software packages, while the latter is all but forgotten in textbooks. Given its intuitive appeal, why did Pearson 2 disappear? Is it ever useful? Using Monte Carlo simulation, tables of percentiles are created for Pearson 2. It is shown that while Pearson 2 has lower power, it matches classroom explanations of skewness and can be calculated when summarized data are available. This paper suggests reviving the Pearson 2 skewness statistic for the introductory statistics course because it compares the mean to the median in a precise way that students can understand. The paper reiterates warnings about what any skewness statistic can actually tell us.},

The FORM is computationally efficient, but may not be accurate for nonlinear limit-state functions. An alternative system reliability analysis method is proposed based on saddlepoint approximation. Unlike the FORM that linearizes limit-state functions in a transformed random space, the proposed method linearizes the limited-state functions without any transformation. After the linearization, the joint probability density of limit-state functions is estimated by the multivariate saddlepoint approximation. Without the nonnormal-to-normal transformation, the present method is more accurate than the FORM when the transformation increases the nonlinearity of limit-state functions. As demonstrated in the two examples, the new method is also as efficient as the FORM.},

  abstract = {The early history of the Gram-Charlier series is discussed from three points of view: (1) a generalization of Laplace's central limit theorem, (2) a least squares approximation to a continuous function by means of Chebyshev-Hermite polynomials, (3) a generalization of Gauss's normal distribution to a system of skew distributions. Thiele defined the cumulants in terms of the moments, first by a recursion formula and later by an expansion of the logarithm of the moment generating function. He devised a differential operator which adjusts any cumulant to a desired value. His little known 1899 paper in Danish on the properties of the cumulants is translated into English in the Appendix. /// L'histoire ancienne de la s{\'e}rie de Gram et Charlier est discut{\'e}e selon trois points de vue: (1) une g{\'e}n{\'e}ralisation du th{\'e}or{\`e}me central-limite de Laplace, (2) une approximation par la m{\'e}thode des moindres carr{\'e}s d'une fonction continue au moyen de polyn{\^o}mes de Chebyshev et Hermite, (3) une g{\'e}n{\'e}ralisation de la distribution normale de Gauss {\`a} une syst{\`e}me de distributions asym{\'e}triques.

  abstract = {Innovations in the finance industry are an important tool to enhance profitability and to increase a nation's wealth. It, therefore, is not astonishing that there is much empirical work on innovations in finance. Most of the work however is concerned with the design of innovative products. The question on how innovations are established and pushed through in financial markets is mostly neglected. Hardly any asks: How do we develop new ways of pricing derivatives, how do we enhance risk control, how do we generate new processes that may enhance the profitability of finance business? The second sector innovation theory in the last decades has taken a different approach. To understand innovation better researchers have focused on the question on how innovations have been emerging. Studies on the history of innovations opened a promising line of research that helps to understand innovation processes much better (see Hughes 1983 und Callon 1986). A similar approach has yet not been adapted to innovation theories in financial markets.1 Accordingly it is the articles objective to evaluate the outcome of a transfer of innovation theories from the second into the third sector. The transfer is conducted on the example of the BlackScholes option pricing formula, an innovation with a strong influence on the efficiency of decisions in the option market. The article shows how the innovation emerged and what factors influenced the diffusion process.},

  abstract = {Let \${\textbackslash}\{F\_n(x){\textbackslash}\}\$ be a sequence of distribution functions depending on a parameter \$n\$, and converging to a limiting distribution \${\textbackslash}Phi(x)\$ as \$n\$ increases. Then a generalized expansion of Cornish-Fisher type is an asymptotic relation between the quantiles of \$F\_n\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\$. The original Cornish-Fisher formulae [3], [5] provided leading terms of these expansions in the case of normal \${\textbackslash}Phi\$, expressing a normal deviate in terms of the corresponding quantile of \$F\_n\$ and its cumulants (the "normalizing" expansion) and, conversely, the quantiles of \$F\_n\$ in terms of its cumulants and the corresponding quantiles of \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ (the "inverse" expansion). The value of both these asymptotic formulae has been well illustrated by their use in approximating the quantiles of complicated distributions (Johnson and Welch [9], Fisher [4], Goldberg and Levine [6]), and for obtaining random quantiles for distribution sampling applications (Teichroew [13], Bol'shev [2]). For a survey of the literature on Cornish-Fisher expansions, and some discussion of their validity, see Wallace ([14], Section 4). In Sections 2, 3 of the present paper, formal expansions are obtained which generalize the Cornish-Fisher relations to arbitrary analytic \${\textbackslash}Phi\$. Essentially, these expansions provide algorithms for transforming an asymptotic expansion of \$F\_n\$ in terms of the "standard" distribution \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ into asymptotic relations between the quantiles of these distributions. The "standardizing" expansion of the quantile \$u\$ of \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ in terms of the corresponding quantile \$x\$ of \$F\_n\$ is expressed (Section 2) in terms of a sequence of functions defined by a differential recurrence operator. A similar differential operator appears in the generalized "inverse" expansion for \$x\$ in terms of \$u\$ (Section 3), which arises from the application of Lagrange's inversion formula to the equation of quantiles. An asymptotic expansion for quantiles of the Wilks likelihood ratio criterion is given as an example. Formal expansions in terms of the cumulants of \$F\_n\$ and \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ are obtained in Section 4 by developing \$F\_n\$ about \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ as a Charlier differential series and collecting terms of like degree in the resulting exponential series. For known cumulants and for normal \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ these formal expressions reduce, as shown in Section 5, to a general form of the Cornish-Fisher expansions, in which the polynomial terms are represented as sums of products of Hermite polynomials. This representation is shown in Section 6 to account for some properties of the Cornish-Fisher polynomials.},

Moreover, consistent with its theoretical effect on expected option returns, the volatility risk premium is positively related to future index option returns and this relationship is stronger for OTM options and at-the-money straddles. Finally, we find the jump risk premium contributes to some portion of OTM put option returns.},

It proposes a data-driven procedure to credibly identify the number and timing of breaks and applies it on the benchmark stock-market indices of 27 OECD countries. The findings suggest that a substantial element of the observed deviations from normality might indeed be due to the co-existence of breaks and GARCH effects. However, the presence of structural changes is found to be the primary reason for the non-normality and not the GARCH effects. Also, there is still some remaining excess kurtosis that is unlikely to be linked to the specification of the conditional volatility or the presence of breaks. Finally, an interesting sideline result implies that GARCH models have limited capacity in forecasting stock-market volatility.},

We show it has a unimodal density and a quantile function that is twice continuously differentiable as a function of mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis. We show how to obtain random variates efficiently and how to test goodness-of-fit. We apply the Cornish--Fisher distribution to fit hedge-fund returns and estimate conditional value-at risk.

Skewness comprises two components: skewness of short-horizon returns and a leverage effect, that is, covariance between variance and lagged returns. We provide similar results for kurtosis.

  abstract = {In this paper, we compute closed-form expressions of moments and comoments for the CIR process which allows us to provide a new construction of the transition probability density based on a moment argument that differs from the historic approach. For Bates' model with stochastic volatility and jumps, we show that finite difference approximations of higher moments such as the skewness and the kurtosis are unstable and, as a remedy, provide exact analytic formulas for log-returns. Our approach does not assume a constant mean for log-price differentials but correctly incorporates volatility resulting from Ito's lemma. We also provide R, MATLAB, and Mathematica modules with exact implementations of the theoretical conditional and unconditional moments. These modules should prove useful for empirical research.},

Leveraging high-frequency data, we explore, in a data-science type exercise, various spot-volatility estimation and sampling techniques, improving existing methods to enhance parameter accuracy. Through extensive simulations, we report difficulties in generating correct parameter estimates for realistic parameter settings where the volatility dynamic does not satisfy the Feller condition. Applying these methods to blue-chip stocks and cryptocurrencies, we uncover distinct parameter patterns between asset classes. Additionally, we examine the model's suitability for modeling extreme returns and perform Value at Risk (VaR) analysis, revealing limitations in capturing tail behavior. This study contributes valuable insights into the practical implementation of the Heston model and its applicability to high-frequency financial data.},

  abstract = {This book focuses on the probabilistic theory ofBrownian motion. This is a good topic to center a discussion around because Brownian motion is in the intersec tioll of many fundamental classes of processes. It is a continuous martingale, a Gaussian process, a Markov process or more specifically a process with in dependent increments; it can actually be defined, up to simple transformations, as the real-valued, centered process with independent increments and continuous paths. It is therefore no surprise that a vast array of techniques may be success fully applied to its study and we, consequently, chose to organize the book in the following way. After a first chapter where Brownian motion is introduced, each of the following ones is devoted to a new technique or notion and to some of its applications to Brownian motion. Among these techniques, two are of para mount importance: stochastic calculus, the use ofwhich pervades the whole book and the powerful excursion theory, both of which are introduced in a self contained fashion and with a minimum of apparatus. They have made much easier the proofs of many results found in the epoch-making book of It{\"o} and McKean: Diffusion Processes and their Sampie Paths, Springer (1965).},

However, market microstructure poses challenges to this estimation approach, as evidenced by recent empirical studies in finance. The present work attempts to lay out theoretical grounds that reconcile continuous-time modeling and discrete-time samples. We propose an estimation approach that takes advantage of the rich sources in tick-by-tick data while preserving the continuous-time assumption on the underlying returns. Under our framework, it becomes clear why and where the ``usual'' volatility estimator fails when the returns are sampled at the highest frequencies. If the noise is asymptotically small, our work provides a way of finding the optimal sampling frequency. A better approach, the ``two-scales estimator,'' works for any size of the noise.},

We study two derivative contracts -- skewness swap and kurtosis swap -- which trade the forward realized third and fourth cumulants. Using S\&P 500 index options data from 1996 to 2005, we document the returns of these swap contracts, i.e., skewness risk premium and kurtosis risk premium.
